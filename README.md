bootstrap 4 stuff

Include every Bootstrap JavaScript plugin with one of our two bundles. Both bootstrap.bundle.js and bootstrap.bundle.min.js include Popper for our tooltips and popovers, but not jQuery. Include jQuery first, then a Bootstrap JavaScript bundle. For more information about whatâ€™s included in Bootstrap, please see our contents section.
